# fmr-autodamping
Automatic Broadband Ferromagnetic Resonance Signal Processing.

autodamping.m contains the bulk of code

gaussianDerivativeFunction.m, lorentzianDerivativeFunction.m, IPKittelEquation.m, OOPKittelEquation.m are required external support functions

An introduction to the use and functionality of the tool is contained in AutodampingHelp.pptx

An imperfect dataset is included in ExampleData to serve as a starting point. It was collected from 50nm thick YIG in early 2019.
